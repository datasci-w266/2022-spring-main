    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental building block of modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques are high-dimensional mathematical word representations. Though there are numerous ways to mathematically quantify words in text, e.g. frequncy, TF-IDF etc., these methods all have particular drawbacks. An alternative, first described by Mikolov et al. (2013) was to utilize neural models to estimate these word representations in a vector space. This technique resulted in the popular Word2Vec language model, which has been widely adopted and utilized. Models like Word2Vec are trained on a single corpus of text data, and produce single word representations for each word in a corpus vocabulary. These representations are typically 1x200 in dimension, i.e. each word has 200 \"dimensions\" of features that encode its semantic and syntatic properties. Word2Vec can produce word representations with a dimensionality of up to 300. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar high-dimensional word representations are produced by models such as GloVe (global vectors for word representation), described by Pennington et al. (2014), which is a log-bilinear model which is trained on non-zero entries of a global word-word co-occurrence matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the problem with word representations produced by both of the aforementioned is that they are \"static.\" This means that a single representation is produced for a word, which is consequently a product of the word appearing in *every* vocabulary context. Think about the word \"flies\". Depending upon how its used, it could be a verb or a noun:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noun:** There are *flies* in my kitchen.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.pestworld.org/media/560912/istock_000001759709small_2-flies.jpg?preset=pestFeature1280)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verb:** Jane *flies* to London on Tuesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-2000w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_29/3397778/200717-british-airways-747-al-0858.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, for certain tasks such as machine translation among many others, a single static word representation may produce inaccuracies and negatively affect performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Language Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "A substantial advancement in NLP came with the introduction of contextualized language models such as the bidirectional encoder representation for transformers (BERT) (Devlin et al. 2018). Since the release of Word2Vec, advances had already been made by creating models that could incorporate syntax, morphology, subwords and subcharacters. Nevertheless, the single biggest performance increase has been conferred by models that can incorporate context. BERT, in particular, is a model that has been first trained on massive text corpora (e.g. Wikipedia) and is designed to produce \"just in time\" word embeddings for tasks that notably include language translation and prediction. By initial training on massive corpora, in its core-state BERT possesses a series of context-agnostic word representation layers that are then fine tuned (NB: \"fine tuned\" in this context refers to a different process than further tweaking an already trained BERT model for performance enhancement in a particular domain or task) by passing a sentence example into it. The resulting output is a sequence of word representations for each word in a sentence that are uniquely influenced by each word in that sentence - i.e. they are contextual word representations. \n",

    "**Converting Contextual Word Representations into Static Word Representations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we showed how BERT produces unique, contextualized representations for a single word depending upon a context in which it appears. Nevertheless, these representations, aside from being different in dimensionality from those produced by a Word2Vec or GloVe model, cannot readily be compared to vectors produced by the latter language models. This is because word representations produced by Word2Vec, for example, are representative of the word as it appears in in all contexts in a particular corpus, whereas these representations are representative of the words in that particular example only. Thus, in an attempt to permit comparability for academic and other reasons, Bommasani et al. (2020) devised a method to convert contextual word representations (like the ones we have just produced) into those that are similar to those produced by static language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Bommasani et al. (2020) proposed two methods to produce word representations from contextual language models that were comparable to those produced by static models. The first is simply to use a single context for each word, like we have done above. Nevertheless, even though in theory BERT has been trained on corpora much larger than would be practical to train a Word2Vec or GloVe model on, it can be shown that at various language benchmarking tasks such as SimLex999 and SimVerb3500 (see Bommasani paper for more detail), using a single contextualized example substantially underperforms compared to static language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential approach is to aggregate several contextual examples and produce a single, aggregated word representation for each word. Though this is a largely experimental technique, Bommasani et al. (2020) demonstrated that using this approach, word representations substantially outperformed those produced by static language models at various language benchmarking tasks. The following sections will demonstrate various approaches to achieve this. The utils.py file contains some helper functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Encoding a Series of Sentences**\n",

    "If we want to aggregate a series of contextual examples for a particular word of interest, we will need to encode all of these. Lets use the word \"interest\" in this example:"
